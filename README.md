# Description

This is a marketplace app. Using this app users can create a profile, list items to sell, shop for items, and communicate with other users on the site. All products listed by a given user will show up on their own personal page, or you can view other users pages. So if you find a seller you like, you can look for other things they sell. The site also contains a search function, for when you’re looking for that special something for a special someone.

# Challenges

One of our members, Paul, was out sick for most of the project. Him working remote added several more communication challenges, and his brain working at 50% (his words) didn't help either.
